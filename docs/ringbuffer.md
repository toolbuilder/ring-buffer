## RingBuffer

RingBuffer implements classic fixed length ring buffer, or circular queue.

The methods match the Array signature for push, pop, unshift, and shift.

For buffer operation either use push/shift together, or unshift/pop together.

RingBuffer is substantially faster than an Array for this use case.

* `capacity` **[Number][11]** maximum number of values in the buffer

## clear

Empties the ring buffer.

## back

Returns the back of the buffer, or `undefined` if empty

## front

Returns the front of the buffer, or `undefined` if empty

## push

Pushes a value onto the back of the buffer. If length === capacity,
the value at the front of the buffer is discarded.

* `value` **any** value to push

Returns the current length of the buffer

## pop

Removes a value from the back of the buffer and returns it. The
newly empty buffer location is set to undefined to release any
object references.

Returns the value removed from the back of the buffer
or `undefined` if empty.

## shift

Removes a value from the front of the buffer and returns it. The
newly empty buffer location is set to undefined to release any
object references.

Returns the value removed from the front of the buffer
or `undefined` if empty.

## unshift

Pushes a value on the front of the buffer. If length === capacity,
the value at the back is discarded.

* `value` **any** to push onto the front

Returns the current length of the buffer.

## iterator

Iterator that goes from front to back.

Returns **Generator** iterates from front to back
